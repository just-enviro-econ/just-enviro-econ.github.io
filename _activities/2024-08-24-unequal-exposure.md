Abstract
</summary>

<p>
Environmental justice issues have been absent or downplayed in most environmental economics textbooks and classes. This omission is a lost opportunity to teach and extend core economic concepts while attracting a diverse set of students. In this article, the authors share different perspectives and teaching materials to introduce an environmental justice module into an environmental economics course. Their approach combines traditional economic concepts and methods with case studies and insights from other disciplines. This approach is proposed in the hope of advancing two goals. First, the approach aims to create a module accessible and appealing to a broader set of students than is traditionally represented in the economics discipline. Second, the materials help convey the relevance of economic ideas and analysis to real-world issues.
