In this episode, host Daniel Raimi talks with Kelsey Jack, an associate professor and scholar of environmental economics and international development at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Jack describes the challenge of improving environmental quality in developing countries, where residents confront a variety of individual pressures that can trump environmental health as priorities, from electricity access to the availability of clean water. Reflecting on her own experimental economics research, Jack contends that paying families to conserve nature can aid those in need while encouraging environmental stewardship.
