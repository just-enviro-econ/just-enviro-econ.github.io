**<span class="bold-podcast">Summary from website:</span>**
In New Zealand, a nationwide extermination campaign is underway. It's one of the most ambitious in the world. The country is home to more than four thousand native species that are threatened or at risk of extinction. To protect its biodiversity, New Zealand has embarked on an experiment that aims to eradicate all invasive species by the year 2050. Can the country pull it off? And how far should humans go to reverse the damage we've caused?
