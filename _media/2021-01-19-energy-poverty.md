In this episode, host Daniel Raimi talks with Tony Reames, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability. Reames defines “energy poverty,” explores why people of color and those living in low-income communities are most affected, and describes existing public policies that are designed to help underserved households pay their energy bills. Given that climate change threatens to intensify existing disparities, Reames contends that governments should do more to measure energy poverty, target aid to the neighborhoods most in need, and help reduce the costs of energy efficiency technologies.
